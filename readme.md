This is a set of p5js examples I'm working on.
I'm limiting the canvas to 128x64, so later I can
redo this examples in an esp8266 with a tiny oled display.

## Instructions

The project uses [chiunhau/p5-manager](https://github.com/chiunhau/p5-manager). To run:

```
cd p5sketches
p5 s
```

*current todo*

- add an actual readme file
- move examples to functions so I can remix effects
- load bitmaps and sprites
- record examples as gifs
