This is a set of p5js examples I'm working on.
I'm limiting the canvas to 128x64, so later I can
redo this examples in an esp8266 with a tiny oled display.

## Instructions

The project requires [chiunhau/p5-manager](https://github.com/chiunhau/p5-manager). To run:

```
npm start
```

_current todo_

- add an actual readme file
- move examples to functions so I can remix effects
- load bitmaps and sprites
- record examples as gifs
